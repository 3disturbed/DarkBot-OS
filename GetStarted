Setting Up a Self-Updating Node.js Server for DarkBot-OS

This guide will walk you through setting up a Node.js server for DarkBot-OS that can automatically update itself from a GitHub repository. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a server that checks for updates, downloads the latest code, and restarts itself to apply the updates.
Prerequisites

    Node.js installed on your system
    A GitHub account with access to the DarkBot-OS repository
    Basic knowledge of Node.js and GitHub

Step 1: Clone the DarkBot-OS Repository

First, clone the DarkBot-OS repository to your local machine:

bash

git clone https://github.com/3disturbed/DarkBot-OS.git
cd DarkBot-OS

Step 2: Install Required Packages

Navigate to your project directory and install the necessary packages:

bash

npm install express http ws serialport node-fetch tar fs-extra

Step 3: Run the Server

Start your server using the start script:

bash

npm start

Your Node.js server will now periodically check for updates from the specified GitHub repository, download the latest code if a new commit is found, and restart itself to apply the update. You can interact with the server using the simple HTML frontend provided.
