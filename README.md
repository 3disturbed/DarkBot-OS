## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A Raspberry Pi (recommended: Raspberry Pi 4)
- Node.js installed
- Basic knowledge of GPIO and robotics

### Installation
# Setting Up a Self-Updating Node.js Server for DarkBot-OS

This guide will walk you through setting up a Node.js server for DarkBot-OS that can automatically update itself from a GitHub repository. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a server that checks for updates, downloads the latest code, and restarts itself to apply the updates.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system
- A GitHub account with access to the DarkBot-OS repository
- Basic knowledge of Node.js and GitHub

## Step 1: Clone the DarkBot-OS Repository

First, clone the DarkBot-OS repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/3disturbed/DarkBot-OS.git
cd DarkBot-OS
```

## Step 2: Install Required Packages

Navigate to your project directory and install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install express http ws serialport node-fetch tar fs-extra
```

## Step 3: Set Up PM2

PM2 is a process manager for Node.js applications that will help you keep your application running and manage restarts.

Install PM2 globally on your system:

```bash
npm install pm2 -g
```

Start your application using PM2:

```bash
pm2 start updater.js --name darkbot-updater
pm2 start server.js --name darkbot-server
```

Save the PM2 process list and corresponding environments:

```bash
pm2 save
```

Set up PM2 to start on boot:

```bash
pm2 startup
```

Follow the instructions displayed in your terminal to complete the setup.

## Step 4: Run the Server

Start your server using the PM2 start script:

```bash
npm start
```

Your Node.js server will now periodically check for updates from the specified GitHub repository, download the latest code if a new commit is found, and restart itself to apply the update. You can interact with the server using the simple HTML frontend provided.

---

By following these steps, you can set up a self-updating Node.js server for DarkBot-OS, ensuring that your application always runs the latest version from your GitHub repository.

### Configuration
Access the web interface at `http://your-raspberry-pi-ip:3000` to begin configuring your GPIOs and system settings. Detailed documentation is available in the `docs` folder to guide you through each step.
