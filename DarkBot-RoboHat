DarkBot-Hat

The concept of a Industrial Spec Pi hat, Rather than a cheap shoddy robo hat, Something overkill.
Everything should be modular and easy to swap out. The last Robo-Hat you well ever need.

Pin header mounted Teensy 4.1 to supply PWM and ADC via 1mbs UART isolated by ADUM1201.

1mbs UART HW Serial interface to the PI through ADUM1201 energy efficient digital isolators

Daisylink port also protected by ADUM1201 energy efficient digital isolators

4 DC Motor outputs through ADUM1201 energy efficient digital isolators driving DRV8833 heatsinked motor drivers. All Push Fit modules. 
This provides a barrier of protection for logic devices and ensures clean transmition of signals and no noise getting back to the MCU's.

If you let out the pixies it will be localized reducing replacement part cost to a couple of buck's. 

*4 DC motors (1.5amp constant, 3 amp peak)
*10 Dedicated Servo Channels
*8 Multiuse IO supporting Digital or ADC. 


Built in battery voltage detector

ADUM1201 energy efficient digital isolators protect the Dedicated Hardware Serial Expansion Port to add more IO using custon IO Extenders 
(For Example: Enabling 16 ADC's and 16 PWM or servo connections as an expansion, 
Or daisylink another Hat to gain 4 more DC Motors and 10 more servos and 8 more MultiuseIO's 
and another expansion port!. 2 Hats = 8 motors, 20 servos and 16 GPIO, And you can add more...)
