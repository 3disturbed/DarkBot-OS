DarkBot-Hat: The Ultimate Industrial-Grade Pi Hat

Introducing the DarkBot-Hat, an industrial-spec Pi hat designed to be the ultimate, overkill solution for robotics and automation projects. Unlike cheap, unreliable robo hats, the DarkBot-Hat is built to last, offering modularity and easy swappability for a seamless, robust experience. It's the last robo-hat you'll ever need.
Features and Specifications
Pin Header Mounted Teensy 4.1

    PWM and ADC Capabilities: Delivers precise PWM and ADC functionalities via a high-speed 1Mbps UART.
    Isolation: Utilizes ADUM1201 energy-efficient digital isolators for clean, noise-free signal transmission.

Industrial-Grade UART Interface

    High-Speed Communication: 1Mbps UART hardware serial interface to the Raspberry Pi, protected by ADUM1201 isolators.
    Noise Protection: Ensures clean, reliable communication between the Teensy 4.1 and the Pi.

Modular Design

    Daisylink Port: Expandable via ADUM1201-isolated daisy chain ports, allowing for easy addition of more hats and modules.
    Push-Fit Modules: All components are modular and push-fit, making replacements and upgrades hassle-free.

Motor and Servo Control

    4 DC Motor Outputs: Each capable of 1.5A constant current and 3A peak, controlled via heatsinked DRV8833 motor drivers and isolated by ADUM1201 isolators.
    10 Dedicated Servo Channels: Ready for high-precision servo control.

Multiuse I/O

    8 Multiuse I/O Pins: Configurable as digital inputs/outputs or ADC channels, providing flexibility for various applications.

Built-in Battery Voltage Detector

    Real-Time Monitoring: Keeps track of battery voltage to ensure optimal performance and safety.

Expandability and Customization

    Hardware Serial Expansion Port: Protected by ADUM1201 isolators, allows for adding custom I/O extenders.
        Example Expansion: Add 16 ADCs and 16 PWM/servo connections or daisy chain another DarkBot-Hat for additional motors, servos, and I/O.
    Scalable Solution: With two DarkBot-Hats, you can control 8 motors, 20 servos, and 16 GPIOs, with further expansion possibilities.

Built for Reliability

    Localized Damage Control: If any components fail, the design ensures that issues are localized, reducing replacement costs to just a few dollars.
    Robust Protection: ADUM1201 digital isolators provide a robust barrier, protecting logic devices and ensuring clean signal transmission, free from noise interference.
